# Ignore Files

When changing ignore files, please review:

-   `clevercanyon/skeleton/.gitignore` (master copy of ignores)
-   `clevercanyon/skeleton/.npmignore` (mostly a copy of `.gitignore`, but with a few additions at bottom)

If you're @jaswrks, also be sure to review these:

-   `jaswrks/dotfiles.mac/src/resources/mac-setup/bin/dotfiles.js` (bin script installer)
-   `jaswrks/dotfiles.mac/src/resources/dotfiles/.config/\_libs/vs-code/settings.json` (VS Code settings)
