# Skeleton Project Templates

To start a new project with one of our skeletons, simply run:

```bash
$ cd ~/Projects/clevercanyon
$ npx degit clevercanyon/skeleton my-new-project --mode=git
# @todo Create or own tool using degit as inspiration.
```

-   Change `clevercanyon/skeleton` to [any other skeleton project](https://github.com/orgs/clevercanyon/repositories?q=skeleton) you'd like to start from.
-   Change `my-new-project` to the directory you'd like your new project to live in.

## Next Steps

```bash
$ cd ~/Projects/clevercanyon/my-new-project
$ madrun install:project    # Installs NPM dependencies, envs, and builds project.
$ madrun envs:install --new # Interactively sets up new envs in Dotenv Vault for this project.
```

You will need a [Dotenv Vault](https://www.dotenv.org) login. Please contact `@jaswrks` or `@brucewrks` to request access. You must also have an environment meeting all [prerequisites](./prerequisites.md), along with the additional credentials noted at the bottom of the prerequisites article.

-   **Note:** Running `$ madrun envs:install --new` is optional. If your project won't need any environment variables you can skip. Also, if you donâ€™t need environments you should delete the `./.env.vault` file in the main project directory, along with the entire `./dev/.envs` directory. This step is important because if you didn't setup new envs, the existing ones remain connected to the skeleton project, and we don't want any of our update scripts to push changes to the skeletons inadvertently. Delete the `./.env.vault` file!

## Help

```bash
$ madrun install --help
$ madrun envs:install --help
