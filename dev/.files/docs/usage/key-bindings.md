# Key Bindings

Throughout our codebases you will find occassional use of the `ꓺ` character. It's not two dots, it's the [`\uA4FA`](https://graphemica.com/%EA%93%BA#code) multibyte character, and it's allowed in JavaScript variable names. We use it primarily for JavaScript imports. JavaScript ES modules don't currently support importing into an object. So, we create a pseudo object in the form of a variable containing a `ꓺ` character in its name. We find this is helpful when we need to represent that an import is part of something larger than itself.

## Problems We're Solving

As an example, we could import a set of URL utilities like this.

```js
import { $url } from '@clevercanyon/utilities';
const url = $url.parse('https://foo.bar/baz/biz/buz');
```

In fact, we use this approach quite a bit. However, it's not suitable for client-side apps because now we're importing the entire module. The problem is that we've imported the entire module as a single object. As a result, the much larger set of `$url` utilities that we imported is no longer [tree-shakeable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Tree_shaking). Perhaps we only needed `parse`, not the 50 other things that `$url` offers.

Instead, we could do it like this.

```js
import { parse as urlParse } from '@clevercanyon/utilities/url';
const url = urlParse('https://foo.bar/baz/biz/buz');
```

This is reasonable, and more importantly, it's tree-shakeable. Only, it doesn't convey the association that it has with the larger set of `$url` utilities. In a large codebase that leverages imports from many different packages, naming conflicts and confusing prefixes are likely to occur if we kept on using this approach when importing our own modules, alongside those from other packages.

Remember, we're not always working with community-driven NPM packages that have catchy names. We just need a set of URL utilities. There's not time to think about whether we should call it urlZ, or urley, etc. Naming things is hard enough already, we don't need to make cute names a prerequisite for having a readable and maintainable codebase.

## `ꓺ` to the Rescue!

```js
import { parse as $urlꓺparse } from '@clevercanyon/utilities/url';
const url = $urlꓺparse('https://foo.bar/baz/biz/buz');
```

Our strategy is to use a leading `$` to indicate that it's coming from a `@clevercanyon/utilities{,.*}` package. Anytime we use one of our own utilties, we prefix the import with a `$` to indicate it's a utility module. Secondly, when we use the `parse` import throughout our codebases, it now clearly shows that it came from our `$url` utility module.

In other words, this works well as an alternative to `$url.parse`, which we also use primarily in server-side codebases where tree shaking is not as much of a concern. In both cases we have code that is readable — `$urlꓺparse()` looks almost exactly like `$url.parse()`, but the former is tree-shakeable and the latter is not.

## How do we type the `ꓺ` character?

We use a macOS key binding, because we type `ꓺ` a lot!

A key binding, not a shortcut. We do know about tools like Typinator, which are great, but we don't need any lag whatsoever when we're writing code. Set yourself up for productivity because you'll be working in a codebase with this `ꓺ` character all over the place.

## `ꓺ` macOS Key Binding Instructions

Create this file on your computer. Then, restart your computer, open VS Code, and type: <big><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>..</kbd></big> <small>(two periods)</small>. It produces `ꓺ`, which is [`\uA4FA`](https://graphemica.com/%EA%93%BA#code), also known as `&#42234;`. With this new key binding you'll type `ꓺ` quickly, easily, and intuitively.

## VS Code Word Separator Instructions

Another neat trick is to modify VS Code by adding this to your `settings.json` file. By removing `$` and adding `ꓺ` to the list you can now double-click either side of `$urlꓺparse` to select `$url` or `parse`. Whether this behavior is preferrable or not — that’s entirely up to you. @jaswrks's personal preference is to omit `ꓺ` from the list below, treating `ꓺ` as a word character.

```jsonc
{
	// Customizations: removed `$`, added ` ꓺ─‘’“”`.
	// Configuration of this setting matches that of `terminal.integrated.wordSeparators`.
	"editor.wordSeparators": "`~!@#%^&*()-=+[{]}\\|;:'\",.<>/? ꓺ─‘’“”",

	// Configuration of this setting matches that of `editor.wordSeparators`.
	"terminal.integrated.wordSeparators": "`~!@#%^&*()-=+[{]}\\|;:'\",.<>/? ꓺ─‘’“”"
}
```
