/**
 * Tailwind CSS settings file.
 *
 * Tailwind is not aware of this config file's location. We use the exports provided by this file to centralize a few
 * settings associated with Tailwind that are reused across various tools that integrate with Tailwind CSS.
 *
 * @note PLEASE DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE!
 * @note This entire file will be updated automatically.
 * @note Instead of editing here, please review <https://github.com/clevercanyon/skeleton>.
 *
 * @internal Jiti, which is used by Tailwind to load ESM config files, doesnâ€™t support top-level await and does not support
 * `import.meta.url`. Thus, we cannot use async functionality here, and we cannot use our `u` (utilities). Therefore, we
 * produce an extremely watered-down version of our utilities specifically for Tailwind config files.
