# NPM ignore file.
#
# NPM is aware of this config file's location.
#
# Run the following to test configuration:
#
#     $ npm pack --dry-run
#
# Please keep in mind that if `files` is used in `./package.json`,
# the `files` setting will **not** be altered by an `./.npmignore` in the
# main project directory. In such a case, `./.npmignore` is meaningless.
#
# @note CUSTOM EDITS ONLY PLEASE!
# @note In the future this file will be updated automatically.
# @note Only `<custom:start.../custom:end>` will be preserved below.

# There are also a few items always included and/or excluded by NPM.
# See: <https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-json#files>
# See: <https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/developers?v=true#keeping-files-out-of-your-package>
# Other than `package.json`, `README`, `LICENSE|LICENCE`, our rules already cover everything that NPM does.

##
# Customizations.
#
# Please do not attempt to inject exceptions by customizing your projectâ€™s `./.npmignore` file
# in ways that loosen our standard defaults. We have tooling in place that will conflict with your efforts.
# For example, `vite-plugin-c10n-post-process` will automatically prune files from a resulting `./.dist`
# built with our tooling. The pruning that it does strictly adheres to our default `./.npmignore` rules,
# and intentionally does not factor in your customizations.

# <custom:start>
